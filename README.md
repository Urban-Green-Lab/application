# Urban Green Lab Game Application

This application is used to create quizzes that can be administered at events or on the internet.

There is a backend admin site as well as a user application for game play, which also includes a leaderboard.

## Get Started
Get started with local development. Create a branch for the issue you are working on and create all PRs against the `development` branch.

Once the feature has been fully tested with all other code, a PR is created against `main` and merged in to production.
